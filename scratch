https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70243237/how-to-know-if-the-pub-sub-topic-contains-messages-with-specific-content
The solution I ended up with is as follows:

create a set in redis, and add a new message id to it
Include this new message id in the message published to the pubsub
the cloud function that runs after the pubsub should remove the new message_id from the set
by the end of the process, we check the set and if it is empty then the process is done.
This also handle the times when pub/sub publish the same message more than once.
